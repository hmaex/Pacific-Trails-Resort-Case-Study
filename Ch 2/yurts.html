    <h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>What is a yurt?</strong></dt>

        <dd> Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground.<br>
            Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a <br>
            roof dome that can be opened.
        </dd>
        <dt><strong>How are the yurts furnished?</strong></dt>

        <dd> Each yurt is furnished with a queen-sized bed with down quilt and<br>
            gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping experience includes electricity<br>
            and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom<br>
            facilities are located in the lodge.
        </dd>
        <dt><strong>What should I bring?</strong></dt>

        <dd> Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for<br>
            changing weather with layers of clothing. It's also helpful to<br>
            bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
